# Tagram

* **"{username} -> {tag} -> {likes}"**

* **"ban {username}"**

The **username **and** tag **are strings. **Likes** will be an integer number. You need to keep track of **every user**. 

When you receive a **user**,  a **tag** and **likes**, register the user if **he isn't present**, **otherwise add** the tag and the likes. If the user has already used the tag just add the likes to it.

If you receive **"ban {username}"** and **the username exists**, remove him from the database.

You should end your program when you receive the command **"end"**. At that point you should print the users, **ordered by total likes in desecending order, then ordered by the tagsâ€™ count in ascending order**. **Foreach** player print their tag and likes.
