# Problem 4. ForceBook

The force users are struggling to remember which side are the different forceUsers from, because they switch them too often. So you are tasked to create a web application to manage their profiles. You should store information for every **unique forceUser**, registered in the application.

You will receive **several input lines** in one of the following formats:

**{forceSide} | {forceUser}**

**{forceUser} -> {forceSide}**

The **forceUser and forceSide** are strings, containing any character. 

If you receive **forceSide | forceUser** you should **check if such forceUser already exists**, and **if not**, **add** him/her to the corresponding side. 

If you receive a **forceUser -> forceSide** you should check if there is such **forceUser** already and if so, **change his/her side**. If there is no such **forceUser**, add him/her to the corresponding forceSide, treating the command **as new registered forceUser.****Then you should print on the console: ****"{forceUser} joins the {forceSide} side!"**** **

You should end your program when you receive the command **"Lumpawaroo"**. At that point you should print each force side, **ordered descending by forceUsers count, than ordered by name**. For each side print the **forceUsers**, **ordered by name**.

In case there are **no forceUsers in a side**, you **shouldn`t print** the side information. 

## Input / Constraints

* The input comes in the form of commands in one of the formats specified above.

* The input ends when you receive the command **"Lumpawaroo"**.

## Output

* As output for each forceSide, **ordered descending by forceUsers count**, **then by name**,  you must print all the forceUsers, **ordered by name alphabetically**.

* The output format is:

**Side: {forceSide}, Members: {forceUsers.Count}**

**! {forceUser}**

**! {forceUser}**

**! {forceUser}**

* In case there are **NO** **forceUsers**, don`t print this side. 

## Examples

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Input</td>
    <td>Output</td>
    <td>Comments</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Light | Gosho
Dark | Pesho
Lumpawaroo</td>
    <td>Side: Dark, Members: 1
! Pesho
Side: Light, Members: 1
! Gosho</td>
    <td>We register Gosho in the Light side and Pesho in the Dark side. After receiving "Lumpawaroo" we print both sides, ordered by membersCount and then by name.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Input</td>
    <td>Output</td>
    <td>Comments</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lighter | Royal
Darker | DCay
Ivan Ivanov -> Lighter
DCay -> Lighter
Lumpawaroo</td>
    <td>Ivan Ivanov joins the Lighter side!
DCay joins the Lighter side!
Side: Lighter, Members: 3
! DCay
! Ivan Ivanov
! Royal
</td>
    <td>Although Ivan Ivanov doesn`t have profile, we register him and add him to the Lighter side.
We remove DCay from Darker side and add him to Lighter side.
We print only Lighter side because Darker side has no members.
